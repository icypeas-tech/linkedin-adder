The definitive solution that is both free and open-source, designed for automatically accepting connection requests on LinkedIn!

</h1>


LinkedIn Adder is an open-source Chrome extension developed by the Icypeas team, enabling you to effortlessly accept connection requests on LinkedIn using a provided button.

Is it possible to accomplish this without using a button? This involves fetching the user's session cookie to initiate requests for accepting connection requests.
‚Ä¢ Look for an Npoint API (a command that facilitates the action) and examine the DevTools.
‚Ä¢ Locate the API request responsible for accepting connection requests and carry out a manual test within DevTools.
‚Ä¢ Streamline the process through automation (requires the session cookie and an investigation into its feasibility).
