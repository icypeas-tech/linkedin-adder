The solution, free and open-source, crafted for seamlessly automating LinkedIn connection requests acceptance!

</h1>


LinkedIn Adder is a Chrome extension developed by the Icypeas team, an open-source tool that allows you to seamlessly accept LinkedIn connection requests with the click of a button.

Is it possible to accomplish this without using a button? This involves fetching the user's session cookie to initiate requests for accepting connection requests.


- Look for an Npoint API (a command that facilitates the action) and examine the DevTools.
* Locate the API request responsible for accepting connection requests and carry out a manual test within DevTools.
+ Streamline the process through automation (requires the session cookie and an investigation into its feasibility).
